<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP cameras</li><li>Decentralized IP cameras</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Centralized IP cameras are a type of network camera that requires a central network video recorder (NVR) to manage and store recorded footage. These cameras are connected to the NVR through a network cable. On the other hand, decentralized IP cameras have a built-in recording functionality and storage, eliminating the need for a separate NVR. They store footage directly on a local storage device, such as a memory card or hard drive. Decentralized IP cameras are typically easier to install and offer greater flexibility in terms of placement and scalability.</p></p>
