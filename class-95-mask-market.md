<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Class 95 Mask Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>N95</li><li>P95</li><li>R95</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Class 95 masks are respirators that have a filtration efficiency of at least 95% against particulate aerosols. N95 masks are capable of filtering non-oil-based particles and are widely used in healthcare settings. P95 masks are oil-proof and offer additional protection against oily particles. R95 masks, on the other hand, are oil-resistant but do not provide the same level of protection as P95 masks. These masks play a vital role in preventing the inhalation of harmful particles and are essential for personal safety, particularly during times of respiratory outbreaks or hazardous environments.</p></p>
