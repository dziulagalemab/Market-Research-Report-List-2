<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Triple Vacuum Insulated Glazing (TVIG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tempered Type</li><li>Non-tempered Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Triple Vacuum Insulated Glazing (TVIG) is a highly efficient glazing system that consists of three glass panes separated by vacuum spaces. It offers superior insulation, reducing heat transfer and improving energy efficiency. TVIG market types include tempered and non-tempered options. Tempered TVIG is made by heating the glass to a high temperature and then rapidly cooling it, enhancing its strength and safety. Non-tempered TVIG does not undergo this process and is thus more vulnerable to breakage. These market types cater to different requirements and preferences in terms of durability and safety in building construction.</p></p>
