<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fixed Wiring Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steel Wire Armoured</li><li>Aluminium Wire Armoured</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Fixed Wiring Cables market includes two main types: Steel Wire Armoured (SWA) and Aluminium Wire Armoured (AWA). SWA cables have a layer of steel wires around the insulation, providing protection against mechanical damage and offering high tensile strength. They are typically used in underground installations or where cables may be exposed to external pressures. On the other hand, AWA cables use aluminium wires for armoring, making them more lightweight and cost-effective. They are commonly used in indoor applications where their flexibility and lower electrical conductivity are advantageous.</p></p>
